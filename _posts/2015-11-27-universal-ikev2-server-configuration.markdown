title: Universal IKEv2 Server Configuration
---

![IKEv2 vs Other VPN](/img/ikev2_vs_othervpn.png) IKEv2 is a modern protocol developed by Microsoft and Cisco which was chosen as a default VPN type in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and Windows since 7. It supports strong encryption, auto reconnection on network change ([MOBIKE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4555)), easy configuration and more.

This manual describes minimal IKEv2 server configuration for the most simple client setup based on username/password authentication.

**No 3rd party software required on client side** Only native OS tools used on client devices with Windows, MacOS, iOS.

**No certificates importing on client** Simple configuration. Just type login/passowrd and server address like any other VPN connection.

*IKEv2 supported platforms*

## X.509 Certificates intro

In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks IPsec IKEv2 server always authenticates itself with an X.509 certificate using a strong RSA or ECDSA signature. After a secure communication channel has been established, clients authenticate themselves using the EAP-MSCHAPv2 protocol based on user name and password (or other authentication protocol). This means that client needs to verify X.509 certificate authenticity using [CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) in system keychan. Just as for HTTPS connections in a web browser. Server certificate must be valid for successful client authentication.

There are two ways of getting server certificate:

**1.** Use certificate issued by CA trusted by most operating systems. **2.** Issue self-signed certificate and distribute your own CA to every clients' system.

The First way makes connection setup much easier on client side because it does not require importing any certificates in the system. This way is recommended. Self-signed certificates are more complicated. Follow this way only if you know exactly what you need them for and how to manage your own PKI.

### Issue certificate from one of Ceritifaces Authorities

Fortunately X.509 certificates that we used to deploy as SSL certificates for HTTPS web servers are also suitable for IKEv2. You can get free certificate from [Wosign](https://buy.wosign.com/free/), [StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com/), or [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or any of your favorite CA.

The only few requirements wich certificate must comply with:

* Have an Extended Key Usage (EKU) flag explicitly allowing the certificate to be used for authentication purposes. OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 (often called TLS server authentication) All certificated issued for web servers authenitcation have this flag.

* Subdomain wich will be used as IKEv2 server adress must be in Subject Alternative Name. Needed domain must be added as a additional domain, not as general one when issuing SSL certificate. I will use `tunnel.zhovner.com` as example.

* *(Optional)* If possible choose SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 signature algorithm, because SHA-1 is weak and deprecated.

![ipsec x509](/img/ipsec_x509.png)

### Selfsigned certificates

Selfsigned certificates requires to deploy complete [PKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure). Issue your own Root Certificate Authority (CA), destribute this CA to all clients systems, issue server certificate, manage CLR (Certificate Revocation List) and OCSP. This subject is very complicated and goes out this manual, so I won't describe it here. In most cases you don't need selfsigned certificates. It is required only if you are planning to use client certificate authentication (without username/password). If you decided to use selfsigned certificates, take a look at [EasyRSA fork](https://github.com/ValdikSS/easy-rsa-ipsec) than allows to issue certificates suitable both for OpenVPN and IKEv2 and simplifies PKI management.

## Server configuration

[strongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org/) - powerfull and open source IPsec/IKEv2 server and client solution. You will need any Linux box with 2.6 or 3.x kernel to run strongSwan server. Check that your favorite distro have strongSwan ≥ 5.x package in repo. If you run Linux in virtual container, make sure that you have XEN or KVM virtualization but not OpenVZ, because OpenVZ not supporting kernel IPsec.

I recommend [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=f29232fc46afc280fceac66c08d46ebfec507fb9) as VPS hosting bacause they provide additional /64 IPv6 routable subnet that easely can be assigned to IPsec clients.

In this example I will use `Debian 8.2 jessie` as most common distro. Make sure that your stongSwan package not older than `5.2.1-6+deb8u2`

Installing strongSwan and extra plugins:

`apt-get install strongswan libcharon-extra-plugins`

On this step you must have all necessary certificates and key files.

List of required files:

**privatekey.pem** — RSA private key which was used for CSR when issuing certificate. Key must be non-encrypted.

**CA.crt** — Root Certificate of your Certificate Authority. It can be downloaded from web or exported from system keychain.

**intermediate1.crt** — intermediate certificate of your Certificate Authority. If you get certificate from WoSign look at *for Other Server.zip* archive.

**intermediate2.crt** — *(optional)* Number of intermediate certificates may be varied, depending on your CA.

**my.crt** — your certificate. In the example this file will be named **tunnel.zhovner.com.crt**

*How this chain looks from Google Chrome certificate information* ![cert chain](/img/x509_chain.png)

Place each file to the proper path:

```
/etc/ipsec.d/private/privatekey.pem
/etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/ca.crt
/etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/intermediate1.crt
/etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/intermediate2.crt
/etc/ipsec.d/certs/tunnel.zhovner.com.crt
```

Edit `/etc/ipsec.secrets` that contains users and private keys credentionals:

{% highlight bash %}
# This file holds shared secrets or RSA private keys for authentication.

# RSA private key for this host, authenticating it to any other host
# which knows the public part.

# this file is managed with debconf and will contain the automatically created private key
# this string can be removed if you not use debconf for strongswan like in our case
include /var/lib/strongswan/ipsec.secrets.inc

# This is private key located at /etc/ipsec.d/private/piratekey.pem
: RSA privatekey.pem

# Create few VPN users for testing
obama : EAP "SuperPassword123"
putin : EAP "KremlinSecure666"
{% endhighlight %}

Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf`:

{% highlight bash %}

# Windows and BlackBerry clients usually goes here
conn ikev2-mschapv2
    rightauth=eap-mschapv2

# Apple clients usually goes here
conn ikev2-mschapv2-apple
    rightauth=eap-mschapv2
    leftid=tunnel.zhovner.com

# If you need assign static IP to some clients for example for port forwarding
# it can be matched by specific rightid
# conn static-ip-for-putin
#   also="ikev2-mschapv2-apple"
#   rightid=putin
#   rightsourceip=10.1.1.99,2a00:1450:400c:c05::1337
#   rightdns=8.8.8.8,2001:4860:4860::8888
{% endhighlight %}

Restart strongSwan to read new config files:

`systemctl restart strongswan`

Verify that all cerifitaces configured correctly by executing `ipsec listall` Notice that output is very long and must be readed from the top. Full certificates chain must be presented and Entity Certificate must contain "has private key".

```

That's all. If everything looks right try connect to server. For debbuging connection problems run live logs stream `journalctl -f -u strongswan`

#### NAT

For let out VPN clients into Internet you need configure NAT. This subject is not covered in this manual.

For testing porpose *(insecure)*:

`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip\_forward` `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE`

#### IPv6 issues

It is possible to assign native IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4 to VPN clients. For this you will need additional IPv6 subnet routed to you machine but not assigned on server interface. Unfortunately from lots of VPS providers that I've used, only [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=f29232fc46afc280fceac66c08d46ebfec507fb9) provide additional /64 IPv6 subnet for free.

For DigitalOcean and others providers you will need setup NDP proxy. Related thread [https://lists.strongswan.org/pipermail/users/2015-July/008365.html](https://lists.strongswan.org/pipermail/users/2015-July/008365.html)

## Client configuration<!--base32-c9gq6t9k68pk8c1dc9gq6t9k68-base32-->

### macOS &gt;10.11 and iOS 9 autconfiguration profile

A configuration profile is an XML file that allows you to distribute configuration information. If you need to configure a large number of devices or to provide lots of custom email settings, VPN profiles, network settings, or certificates to a large number of devices, configuration profiles are an easy way to do it. In our case we will use VPN payload for one click configuration. For IKEv2 VPN connections the configuration profile is the only way to set advanced options like ciphers, DH groups, PFS, rekey timeout and so on. More about it [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html)

Configuration profile can be created manually or via [Apple Configurator 2](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12) utility. Syntax is same for OS X and iOS. Profile can be distributed as mail attachments or via http link. Profile name must end with `.mobileconfig` and if you plan to share it over HTTP web server should response with Content-Type `application/octet-stream`.

### Always On Mode

In Apple terms "Always On" mode prevents user from disconnect VPN manually. This mode can be configured only on device that in supervision mode. But you can do the same without supervision mode in more flexible way by usign rule that connects VPN automatically every time when you have internet connection. And reconnect it when connection lost. "On demand" mode can be configured only via `.mobileconfig` profile.

This mode can cause a problems when you can't connect to the VPN server, becuase it will block internet access without VPN connection. To disable `Always On` mode unchek `On Demand` options in VPN connection preferences.

![ikev2 Always on On demand mode without supervision](/img/always_on_ondemand_ikev2.png)

### Debug log in macOS

If your connection doesn't work in macOS, it silently disconnect without any error code. Debug log can be viewed in system utility `Console.app`. Type `networkextension` in search and try to connect.

To **increase** verbosity: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkextension.control.plist LogLevel 6` Back to default: `sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkextension.control.plist LogLevel 5`

### Autoconfig profile template

The easiest way to get working profile is to edit 4 variables in this template: RemoteAddress, RemoteIdentifier, AuthName, AuthPassword. Edit the rest of template following comments. Example profile of our VPN server `supervpn.mobileconfig`:

### iOS manual configuration

![ios ikev2](/img/iosikev2.png)

### OS X 10.11 manual configuration

It's impossible to set advanced options (like ciphers, DH groups, PFS, rekey timeout) via GUI. If you need it use configuration profile method.

1. Create new VPN connection in network preferences ![osx ikev2](/img/osxipsec1.png)

2. Choose type IKEv2 and name of connection ![osx ikev2](/img/osxipsec2.png)

3. Set server address and RemoteID (leftid in ipsec.conf) ![osx ikev2](/img/osxipsec3.png)

4. Enter username and password from ipsec.secrets file ![osx ikev2](/img/osxipsec4.png)

5. Connect to VPN ![osx ikev2](/img/osxipsec4.png)

### Windows 7/8/10 IKEv2 manual configuration

In windows you can't define RemoteID separately from server address, so FQDN should be used. Also keep in mind that IPv6 will not work in windows. ![windows ikev2 vpn](/img/windows_ikev2.png)
