When chameleon was released it was difficult to buy one. Only <a href="http://kasper-oswald.de/gb/chameleonmini/">Kasper-oswald.de</a> offers preordes but not telling the price.  
You can buy assembled and tested device from <a href="https://store.ryscc.com/collections/proxmark-3/products/chameleonmini">ryscc.com</a> but $149 is probably too much.  
So I decide to build one from scratch.
